<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Haecksen Schweiz is a group of ABCD (all but cis dudes) people who wish to have a friendly and safer space for technical exchange, knowledge sharing and a space for learning events.</p>
<p>We are a group of people who are driven by our interest in technology and cybersecurity. Our goal is to collaborate and work together, while respecting different opinions, skills and interests.  We welcome anybody who defines themself as an ABCD (All But Cis Dude) person. We chose this abbreviation, in order to emphasize that also masculine or androgynous read or presenting people are welcome to join us.</p>
<p>Anyone taking part in Haecksen Schweiz events, online and offline, is expected to behave respectfully towards each other. Misbehaviour can lead to exclusion from our events and/or our online infrastructure.</p>
<p>This Code of Conduct has to be acknowledged and accepted by all individuals who participate at an event or are in our group. Therefore the Code of Conduct applies equally to all Haecksen Schweiz participants, including members, guests, speakers, volunteers, ect.</p>
<h2><a name="code-of-conduct"></a>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>We invite and encourage our members and guests to express their opinions on relevant topics. All participants should at all times feel at ease to do so without fearing any form of attack, reprisal or harassment. We ask everybody to be respectful and considerate towards each other, especially when attempting to provide constructive criticism.</p>
<p>To foster tolerance, respect and hospitality in our community, we agree not to engage in discriminatory, disparaging or offensive speech or actions based on disability, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nationality, income, body, age, neurodiversity, religion, profession or any other dimension of discrimination.</p>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Using names and pronouns that someone introduced themselves with</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting &quot;no&quot;s and your own, as well as other&#39;s boundaries</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community while respecting the rights of individuals</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>
<p>We apply the core values of the Chaos Computer Club, namely the hacker ethics and taking a stand against right-wing extremist ideology:</p>

</ul>
<p>We will take action against disruptive behavior, including trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, public or private harassment, publishing others&#39; private information, such as physical or electronic addresses or taking pictures of others without explicit permission.</p>
<p>We strive to cultivate a positive error culture. We are aware that we all make mistakes. Through mutual care, responsibility and forgiveness, we support each other and promote a responsible approach to mistakes.</p>
<p>The Haecksen Schweiz reserves the right to deny participation and/or eject from an event or any of its infrastructure any individual found to be engaging in misconduct contrary to the principles highlighted above.</p>
